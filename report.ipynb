    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "This experiment is to observe the behaviour of two pendulums coupled with spring under some types of oscillations dependent on their initial conditions. Here we use torque constants (denoted as $D$ and $D*$) so that we can include diference in force exerting points smoothly in our calculations. We focus on three types of oscillation mainly two basic motions (called \"in-phase oscillation\" and \"out-phase oscillation\") to extend them into complicated motion (called \"beat mode oscillation\"). Main measurement in our experiment is time period of each oscillations. Property of the spring matters significantly on our observation. Our task is to find out relations of each values with derived theoretical values and compare them with actual experimental values."
